** Explenation of the alg ::
** so this is edmonds karps but using going by node instead of by link
**
** we find the shortest path -- and disable those start && end link nodes
** we update the nodes from that path to say that 1 ant is moving forward on
** those nodes , and that we can send one ant backwards on them as well ;
**
** then we find the new shortest path ignoring the previously used start/end
** links , including all the others ;
** then we update the nodes from the new path to say that 1
** ant is moving forward
** along it and one ant can move back through those nodes ,
** but if a room already
** has an ant moving along it from
** the previous path we set the ants moving along
** it to 2 and and that 0 ants are allowed to move
** backwards through those rooms
** then we reapeat untill we can't construct a new path ;
**
** then we need to adjust the paths that share concurrent rooms , and only ever
** 2 paths will share the same room ;
** we also want to save a copy of the shortest path so that with small amounts
** of ants we can check if that is faster sending on one path
** than sending the max flow along concurrent paths ;
** then we calc the # of ants to send on each path ;;
** not sure exactly how i want
** to do that part yet ;
**
** and then we print the moves on the output ;
